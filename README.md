# Frequency-Moments
Here we give an implementation of the famous online algorithm approximating the frequency moments of a stream of counting data. The outline of the algorithm can be found in "The Space Complexity of Approximating the Frequency Moments", which can be found here:

We implement both the 2nd and kth moment randomized algorithms, as well as a deterministic kth moemnt algorithm. We also provide accuracy-testing scripts.
