# Frequency-Moments
Here we give code to implement the famous online algorithm approximating the frequency moments of a stream of counting data. The outline of the algorithm can be found in "The Space Complexity of Approximating the Frequency Moments", which can be found here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000097915452
